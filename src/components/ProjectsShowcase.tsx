    detailedDescription: "A sophisticated cloud-native log management platform that combines the power of ELK Stack with advanced machine learning for intelligent log classification and real-time monitoring. Provides comprehensive observability for microservices architecture with automated anomaly detection. The system features centralized log aggregation from distributed microservices architecture, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis of application logs across multiple services. The advanced Kibana dashboards provide real-time analytics and custom visualizations for monitoring system health and performance metrics. The BERT-based ML model performs intelligent log classification, automatically categorizing logs as INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, or WARNING based on content analysis. The FastAPI microservice provides high-performance ML inference and API endpoints for real-time log processing. The platform includes Docker Compose orchestration for seamless local development and cloud deployment, along with automated anomaly detection and alerting for proactive system monitoring. The scalable architecture supports high-volume log processing and analysis, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.",
